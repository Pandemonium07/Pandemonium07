## Hi there 👋


🦠🛡️ Cybersecurity Enthusiast | CTF Player | 42 Paris Student 🛡️🦠

Hi! I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast and a student at 42 Paris, constantly honing my skills in ethical hacking, penetration testing, and system security.
I thrive on Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges, where I explore vulnerabilities, exploit misconfigurations, and deepen my understanding of real-world cybersecurity threats.

🔹 Passionate about offensive security: I enjoy breaking things (ethically!) to understand how they work and how to secure them.
🔹 Hands-on learner: I believe in learning by doing, whether it's through CTFs, labs, or personal projects.
🔹 Always improving: I'm currently developing my skills in reverse engineering, web security, and cryptography.

💡 Looking for internship opportunities where I can apply my knowledge, collaborate with experts, and continue growing in the field of cybersecurity.

📫 Let's connect! Feel free to reach out if you're interested in discussing cybersecurity, CTFs, or potential opportunities.
